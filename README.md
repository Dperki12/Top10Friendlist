# Top10Friendlist
This program creates a simple "Top 10 Friends List" where someone can add, replace, or view friends' names. It displays a menu with options for entering a new friend's name, replacing an existing one, showing the list, or quitting. It checks for duplicates when adding friends and prevents the list from exceeding the capacity of 10 names.
